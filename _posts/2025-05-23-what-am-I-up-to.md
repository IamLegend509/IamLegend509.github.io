# What am I upto?
    Well to put it out there I am exploring the domain relating to Digital design using FPGAs, but I don't really like the RISC-V (to work on, it is fire thou). 
    I go out for run sometimes and just wander.
    My friends like to call me somewhat of a Prankster and I like it :)

Also I am currently member of [SRA-VJT](https://sravjti.in/) so check out their [Insta](https://www.instagram.com/sra_vjti/) page.
